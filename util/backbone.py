class ContrastiveLoss(nn.Module):
    '''
    Contrastive Learning Loss Function. The input is the output latent vectors from the backbone network.
    The two inputs are the pairs of latent vectors from the same point cloud and different point clouds.
    For each row, x1 and x2 are the latent vectors from the same point cloud, and x1 and x2 are the latent vectors from different point clouds.
    The shape of the x1 and x2 is (batch_size, latent_dim).
    The output is the contrastive loss.
    The contrastive loss is calculated as follows:
        For each row in x1, calculate the distance between x1[i, :] and x2, and the distance between x1[i, :] and the rest of the x1.
        Then the softmax of all the distances is calculated. 
        The first distance is the distance between x1[i, :] and x2[i, :].
        The rest of the distances are the distances between x1[i, :] and the rest of the x1 and the rest of the x2.
        The contrastive loss is the negative log of the softmax of the first distance.
    The distance is calculated as the cosine similarity.
